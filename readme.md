## Notes

This addon is not finished and may contain bugs. I'm working on it alone while still learning, so some parts of the code might look a bit wild - but that's the plan, to improve it over time.

If you're interested in helping develop it or making improvements, contributions are welcome! There's definitely room for optimization and fixes.

## Known Issues

- **Party Frames Vehicle Bug:** Party frames do not display correctly when party members enter vehicles.
- Many other bugs are still present and will be polished over time.

## Credits

This project combines and adapts code from several sources:

- **[s0h2x](https://github.com/s0h2x)** - Two specific addons: one for action bars and another for minimap, which have been merged and integrated into DragonUI
- **[KarlHeinz_Schneider - Dragonflight UI (Classic)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dragonflight-ui-classic)** - Original addon from which many elements have been taken and backported/adapted to 3.3.5a, including the micro menu and other features built from scratch based on this design
- **[Raz0r1337 - RetailUI](https://github.com/Raz0r1337/RetailUI)** - Reference and inspiration for UI elements and implementation approaches
